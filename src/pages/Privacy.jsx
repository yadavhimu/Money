          each time the user submits a query to the site. RentoMoney uses Web

          information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help RentoMoney, its

        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-5">
          A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is
          usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check
          whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.
          RentoMoney may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count
          users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver
          co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’
          Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique RentoMoney
          may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web
          Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a Web
          Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a
          description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You
          may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective
          by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to
          notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept
          or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.

          We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with
          additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other
          sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties,
          including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of
