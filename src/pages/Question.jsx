          expenses such as emergencies. Also, many factors determine how much
          you can borrow such as income, laws, and regulations of the state
          where you are living. Further, unsecured personal loans are also known
          as signature loans as no guarantor or collateral is required for
          getting the funds. Also, it is considered a quick & convenient way of
          getting a loan in a short period. The best part is that you can apply

          guarantee is not present, and therefore there is a high risk for
          lenders. Thus, it tends to have high-interest rates as compared to
          secured loans.{" "}

          How much money can I borrow?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-5">
          Under the unsecured personal loan category, you can borrow anywhere

          How the loan would be repaid?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-5">
          Similar to the fees & rates associated with the loan, the repayment
          method would also be determined once the loan transfer is done. In
          most cases, the loan withdrawal amount is debited directly from the
          bank account on a fixed date. You just have to make sure that the
          required money is available in your bank account on that particular
          date such that you don’t have to pay late fees. Other payment options
          would also be available depending on the situation.{" "}

          We at MoneyNestCapital suggest that you don’t take any kind of
          unsecured loans if you are not able to repay them. Also, you would be
          subjected to different collection efforts to recover your loan amount.
          Other than this, you would be at risk of losing your credit score
          completely. One thing you also need to keep in mind is that interest
          would be incurred till the time you haven’t paid the loan. So, don’t
          borrow any amount that you are not able to repay, and keep the loan
          repayment amount in your account on the specified date of repayment.{" "}

        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-5">
          {" "}
          As compared to secured loans, unsecured loans don’t need any kind of
          collateral. But, you still have to pay high-interest rates depending
          on the credit that you might be having. So, due to regulations & laws,
          the cost of borrowing an unsecured loan would boil down to your lender
          as well as the state in which you are living. Further, once the loan
          is approved, then you will get a loan agreement that will outline all
          the fees & interest rates associated with your loan.{" "}

        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-5">
          You won’t be getting any loan amount less than $2500. However, you
          should keep in mind that you may find small loan amounts but for that,
          you would have to pay almost double or even more than that. But on the
          contrary, if you take a minimum loan of $2500, then you would just
          have to pay 11%-35% APR depending on the state where you are living.
          So, after knowing all the facts, you can take the decision that is
          best suitable for you.
